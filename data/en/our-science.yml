      At the heart of Nimverta’s approach is a peptide inspired by a well-studied region of the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (NCAM1).
      Our peptide mimics a domain that binds to FGFR1, a growth factor receptor known to control both bone regeneration and vascular development.

  - name: "Bone and Vascular Regeneration"
    content: >
      Rather than forcing bone growth artificially, our therapy reactivates the body’s own regenerative machinery — targeting both bone and the vascular microenvironment that sustains it.
      This dual mode of action offers a long-term, physiologically grounded approach to skeletal repair.

  - name: "Mechanistic Validation"
    content: >
      Based on nearly two decades of published research into NCAM1-FGFR1 signaling, our peptide has been shown to activate key regenerative pathways (ERK1/2, Akt) in relevant cell models.
      These findings provide a strong molecular basis for downstream therapeutic development.
