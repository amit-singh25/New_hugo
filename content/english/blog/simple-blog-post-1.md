**Nimverta**, a Zurich-based biotech startup, has secured CHF 10,000 in funding from [Venture Kick](https://www.venturekick.ch), entering a new phase in its journey to develop first-in-class peptide therapies for bone regeneration. The support is part of [Venture Kick’s Stage I](https://www.venturekick.ch/CHF-10000-for-firstinclass-peptide-therapeutics-E-coli-vaccine-cold-chain-logistics-a-software-for-diplomats-and-therapies-for-bone-disease), designed to catalyze high-potential Swiss startups.

Founded by **Dr. Amit Singh**, with **Prof. Anjali Kusumbe** as Chief Scientific Officer and **Rob Chisholm** as Chief Business Officer, Nimverta targets age-related bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and bone fragility. The company’s innovation lies in its dual-regeneration approach — addressing both bone and the supporting vasculature, which conventional treatments neglect.

> “Current therapies overlook the vascular component of bone healing. Nimverta’s peptide-based approach has the potential to provide a safe, long-term anabolic therapy where none exist,” said Dr. Singh.

With an international scientific advisory board backing the team, Nimverta will use the funds to validate its market opportunity, assess the potential of diseases such as **Hypophosphatasia**, **Paget’s Disease**, and **Osteoporosis**, and strengthen its regulatory and IP positioning.
